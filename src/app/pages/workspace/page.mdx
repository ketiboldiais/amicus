### Sample Space
A __sample space__ is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. The sample space should be:

1. mutually exclusive,
2. collectively exhaustive, and
3. at the right granularity.



#### Binomial Probabilities
Consider a coin tossed ${n \geq 1}$ times in a row, each toss independent. Suppose the probability of heads is:

$$
    P(H) = p.
$$ 

This implies that the probability of tails is:

$$
    P(T) = 1 - p.
$$ 

What is the probability that in the ${n}$ coin tosses, we observe exactly ${k}$ heads? I.e., what is:

$$
    P(k \text{ heads})?
$$ 

We start by considering an example scenario. What is:

$$
    P(HTTHHH)?
$$

We take ${n = 6.}$ Since the tosses are independent, we have:

$$
    P(HTTHHH) = p(1-p)(1-p)ppp = p^4(1-p)^2.
$$

We can generalize the answer:

$$
    P(\text{particular sequence}) = p ^ \text{\# heads} (1 - p) ^ \text{\# tails} 
$$
