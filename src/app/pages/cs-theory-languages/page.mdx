# Theoretical CS: Languages

## Basic Definitions
> __*definition*__. A _symbol_, or a _token_, is an atomic unit that a machine can read and write.

__*example*__. ${1,}$ ${\pi,}$ ${\Sigma,}$ ${0,}$ ${x,}$ ${y,}$ ${f,}$ are all symbols. If your computer can highlight it with its cursor—that's almost certainly a symbol, or token. 

> __*definition*__. An _alphabet_ is a nonempty and finite set of symbols.

A generic alphabet is often denoted with the Greek letter ${\Sigma.}$

> __*definition*__. A _string_ over an alphabet is a sequence of symbols from that alphabet.

A generic string is often denoted with the Greek letters ${\sigma}$ or ${\tau.}$ We use the Greek letter ${\varepsilon}$ to denote the empty string—a sequence of symbols of zero length.  The set of all strings over an alphabet ${\Sigma}$ is denoted ${\Sigma^{*}.}$

> __*definition*__. A _language_ ${L}$ over an alphabet ${\Sigma}$ is a set of strings drawn from ${\Sigma.}$ That is, ${L \subseteq \Sigma^{*}.}$ 

## Language Processors

### Compilers
> __*definition*__. A _compiler_ is a program that reads a program in one language — called the _source language_ — and translates it into an equivalent program in another language — called the _target language_.

Examples of compilers include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and Clang. These compilers take programs written in C or C++, and output the same programs in machine language. Another is javac, which takes programs written in Java, and outputs the same programs in bytcode — a machine language executable by a JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

### Interpreters

> __*definition*__. An _interpreter_ is a program that reads a program and executes the operations specified with inputs supplied by the user.
