## Economics
- A __market__ is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service.
  - Buyers determine the demand, and sellers determine the supply.
- A __competitive market__ is a market where there are enough buyers and sellers that a single buyer has a negligible impact on the demand, and a single seller has a negligible impact on the supply.

## Common Terms
- A __financial instrument__ is a legal contract that creates either a financial asset for one party and/or a financial liability for another. 
- A __security__ is any financial instrument that can be bought, sold, or exchanged (i.e., traded). 
    - There are four types of securities:
        1. [Debt securities](#debt-securities).
        2. Equity securities.
        3. Derivative securities.
        4. Hybrid securities.
- A __capital expenditure (CAPEX)__ is money a company spends to acquire, upgrade, or maintain long-term physical assets like property, buildings, and equipment.
- __Market capitalization (market cap)__ is the most recent market value of a company's outstanding shares:
    $$
        \text{M}_{\text{cap}} = \text{S}_p \times n_{\text{S}} 
    $$
    where ${\text{M}_{\text{cap}}}$ is the market cap, ${S_p}$ is the current share price, and ${n_S}$ is the number of shares outstanding.
- Shareholders want managers to maximize market value.
- Thus, managers have a natural financial objective: Increase the current market value of the company's shares. 

### Financing Decisions
- A corporation has two ways to raise money:
    1. __Lenders__. Corporation ${A}$ asks for an amount of money ${x}$ from ${B.}$ ${A}$ promises to pay back ${x}$ to ${B}$ by a certain date, along with periodic interest payments along the way, according to some fixed rate. This approach is called __debt financing__.    
    2. __Shareholders__. Corporation ${A}$ sells a _share_ of the corporation to ${B,}$ which ${B}$ may or may not sell. If ${B}$ holds on to the share, and ${A}$ decides to pay out dividends, then ${B}$ receives a fraction of the dividends according to their share. This approach is called __equity financing__.   
- A __capital structure decision__ is a corporation's decision in whether to use lenders (debt) or shareholders (equity) to raise money.  

## Debt Securities
- A __debt security__ is a security where (i) one party lends money (the lender or investor) and another borrows (the borrower or issuer), and (ii) the borrower must repay the principal and interest (at the lender's rate) by a given date (called the maturity date). 
- Debt securities are also called __fixed-income securities__ or __debt instruments__.
- Debt securities offer a fixed stream of interest payments that must be paid by the issuer at maturity.
- Debt securities are less risky than equity securities, since they guarantee repayment of principal and interest.
- If the issuer goes bankrupt, debt security holders have priority over equity holders in asset distribution/sales. 
- Common debt securities:
  1. [Government bonds](#government-bonds)
        1. [Treasury bills](#treasury-bills) 
        2. [Treasury notes](#treasury-notes)
        3. [Treasury bonds](#treasury-bonds)
        4. [Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)](#treasury-inflation-protected-securities-tips)
        5. [U.S. Savings bonds](#us-savings-bonds)
  2. Corporate bonds
  3. Municipal bonds
  4. Preferred stock
  5. Notes
  6. Commercial papers
  7. Asset-backed securities
  8. Certificate of Deposits (CDs)
  9.  Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)
  10. Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)
  11. Mortgage-backed Securities (MBSs)
  12. Zero-coupon Securities.

### Government Bonds
- A government bond is essentially a loan to the government.
- When an investor ${X}$ purchases a government bond, the following events occur:
    1. ${X}$ gives money to the government (the price paid for the bond).
    2. The government promises to: (1) pay ${X}$ regular interest payments, and (2) completely repay the principal amount when the bond matures. 
- Government bonds have a few key terms:
    1. The bond's __face value__ (also called __par value__) is the amount of money the investor lends to the government, and the amount they will receive back at maturity.
    2. The bond's __coupon rate__ is the fixed interest rate the bond pays over its lifetime.
    3. The interest payments made by the government are called __coupon payments__.
    4. The bond's __maturity__ is how long the government has to repay the principal amount (it could be a year, five years, seven, ten, etc.). 

#### Treasury Bills
- A __treasury bill__ (also called a __T-bill__) is a U.S. government bond that: 
  1. matures in a year or less, 
  2. does not make coupon payments, 
  3. is sold at a discount from their face value, and 
  4. the return to the investor is the difference between the purchase price and the face value received at maturity. 
- __*example*__. ${X}$ purchases a `$`${10\,000}$ treasury bill at a discount price of `$`${9\,500,}$ maturing in one year. After one year, ${X}$ will receive the full `$`${10\,000.}$ This is a return on investment of `$`${500.}$
    - __*note*__. The amount gained, `$`${500,}$ is subject to federal income tax, but exempt from state and local taxes. 

#### Treasury Notes
- A __treasury note__ (or __T-note__) is a U.S. government bond that:
    1. Comes in maturities of two, three, five, seven, and ten, and
    2. interest payouts occur every six months.
- The interest payout from a T-note is subject to federal income tax, but exempt from state and local taxes.

#### Treasury Bonds
- A __treasury bond (T-bond)__ is a long-term, fixed interest debt security issued by the U.S. government with maturities of 20 or 30 years, with interest payments every six months.
- Treasury bonds are stable, low-risk investments because of their (1) steady semiannual interest payments, and (2) backing by the U.S. government. 
- Cons: They're subject to inflation and interest rate risks.

#### Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
- These are [treasury bonds](#treasury-bonds) that adjust their principal value based on changes in inflation.

#### U.S. Savings Bonds
- U.S. savings bonds are a non-marketable debt security with a guaranteed, but modest, return. These bonds have the following characteristics:
    1. __Non-marketable__. Savings bonds can only be purchased from the U.S. government. Once bought, they cannot be sold to anyone else.
    2. __Purchase limited__. An investor cannot buy more than `$`${10\,000}$ face value of savings bonds in a calendar year.
    3. __Interest payments limited__. Savings bonds accumulate interest; that interest, however, is paid out only after the bonds are redeemed or have matured.     
    4. __Early redemption__. Maturities vary, but they are often between fifteen and thirty years. A bondholder must wait at least twelve months after the initial purchase before redeeming the savings bond, at which point they will receive the face value plus interest.
    5. __Tax incentive__. Interest earned from U.S. savings bonds is subject to federal income tax, but not state or local taxes.  

## Options
> __*scenario*__. Suppose YELP's current share price is `$`${36.}$ Investor ${A}$ goes to ${B,}$ and says: "I'll make you a deal. For `$`${0.8,}$ I'll give you the option to buy shares of YELP at `$`${38}$ per share in the next ${30}$ days." Is this a good deal?
>
> __*response.*__ First, this type of deal is called a _call option_. The price of `$`${38}$ is called the _strike price_, and the price of ${\text{\textdollar}0.8}$ is called the _ask price_. Second, to the question: We don't know if the price of a YELP share will go up or down in the next ${30}$ days. 
> 
> _**Profit Case**_: If the price of a YELP share goes up to `$`${42}$ in the next ${30}$ days, then we're going to make profit: Buy at `$`${38}$ and immediately sell at ${\text{\textdollar}42.}$ That's a ${\text{\textdollar} 42 - \text{\textdollar}38 = \text{\textdollar} 4}$ gain. Recall that we paid ${\text{\textdollar}0.8}$ for the option, so our net profit is: ${\text{\textdollar}4 - \text{\textdollar}0.8 = \text{\textdollar}3.2.}$
> 
> _**Loss Case 1**_: The price goes down. Suppose the price of a YELP share goes down to ${\text{\textdollar}30.}$ Here, you don't exercise the option. Why would you buy shares at ${\text{\textdollar}38}$ when they're at ${\text{\textdollar}30}$? So, you're at a loss of ${-\text{\textdollar}0.8}$ per contract. 
>
> _**Loss Case 2**_: The price goes up, but not enough. Suppose the price of a YELP share goes up to ${\text{\textdollar}37.}$ Here, you don't exercise the option. Why would you buy shares at ${\text{\textdollar}38}$ when they're at ${\text{\textdollar}37}$? Again, you're at a loss of ${-\text{\textdollar}0.8}$ per contract.
> 
> _**Loss Case 3**_: Suppose the price of YELP goes up to ${\text{\textdollar} 38.50.}$ That's a gain of ${\text{\textdollar}38 - \text{\textdollar}38.5 = \text{\textdollar}0.5.}$ Here, however, we have a loss because of transaction costs. Recall that we paid ${\text{\textdollar}0.8}$ for the option: ${\text{\textdollar}0.5 - \text{\textdollar}0.8 = -\text{\textdollar}0.3.}$
> 
> _**Loss Case 4**_: The price of YELP goes up, but too slowly. Options have an expiration date. The price must go up within a certain amount of time. Otherwise, it expires and we're left with a loss of ${-\text{\textdollar}0.8.}$

- Options are marketable—they can be bought and sold like any other financial instrument.
- Many factors affect option pricing. Consider the following sample call options for YELP:

<figure>

| Strike                   | Ask                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| ${\text{\textdollar}39}$ | ${\text{\textdollar}0.55}$ |
| ${\text{\textdollar}38}$ | ${\text{\textdollar}0.8}$  |
| ${\text{\textdollar}37}$ | ${\text{\textdollar}1.15}$ |
| ${\text{\textdollar}36}$ | ${\text{\textdollar}1.55}$ |
| ${\text{\textdollar}35}$ | ${\text{\textdollar}2.25}$ |

<figcaption>YELP</figcaption>
</figure>

### Pricing Options 
- __Lower Strike, Higher Ask__. Notice that the lower the strike price, the higher the ask price. E.g., compare the strike price of ${\text{\textdollar}36}$ against the strike price of ${\text{\textdollar}35.}$ Their ask prices differ by ${\text{\textdollar}2.25 - \text{\textdollar}1.55 = \text{\textdollar}0.7.}$ This is because it's more likely that YELP's price hits ${\text{\textdollar}35}$ than ${\text{\textdollar}36.}$   
- __More Time, Higher Ask__. In the example scenario, we assumed a time limit of ${30}$ days. Options can come in longer durations—say, ${1}$ year. In this case, the likelihood of reaching a higher stock price increases. And with an increased likelihood comes an increased ask price. Thus, we have the following general statements:
  1. If the option's expiration date is sooner, then the option is cheaper.
  2. If the option's expiration date is further, then the option is more expensive.

### Option Increments
<Warning/>

- A very, very important point with options contracts: They are for ${100}$ shares.
- Thus, if you buy ${1}$ options contract of YELP at a ${\text{\textdollar}38}$ strike price, then you're buying the option to buy ${100}$ shares of YELP at ${\text{\textdollar}38.}$
- When the dealer says the ask price is ${\text{\textdollar}0.8,}$ it's ${\text{\textdollar}0.8}$ per share. Since the option comes in ${100}$ shares, one contract is ${100 \times \text{\textdollar}0.8 = \text{\textdollar}80.}$ Thus, if we're buying ${100}$ YELP calls, that's a ${100 \times \text{\textdollar}80 = \text{\textdollar}8\,000}$ purchase. 

### Covered Calls
> __*scenario*__. Suppose INTC (Intel Corp. stock) is priced at ${\text{\textdollar}32}$ ${A}$ buys INTC shares at this price. ${A}$ then goes to buyer ${B}$ and says: "For ${\text{\textdollar}1.5}$ per share, I'll give you the option to buy INTC at ${\text{\textdollar}34}$ within the next two months." What are the possible profit/loss outcomes for ${A?}$ 
>
> __*response*__. This is a call option with a strike price of ${\text{\textdollar}34}$ and an ask price of ${\text{\textdollar}1.5.}$ There are four scenarios for ${A:}$
>
> _**Scenario 1: The INTC share price goes down within the next two months.**_ Suppose it goes down to ${\text{\textdollar}30.}$ Then ${B}$ wouldn't buy the shares from ${A}$ for ${\text{\textdollar}34,}$ since the market has them at ${\text{\textdollar}30.}$  The seller loses ${30 - 32 = -\text{\textdollar}2}$ per share. But, the seller makes ${\text{\textdollar}1.5}$ by selling the call option. So, they're at a loss of ${-\text{\textdollar}2 + \text{\textdollar}1.5 = -\text{\textdollar}0.5.}$ 
>
> _**Scenario 2: The INTC share price does nothing within the next two months.**_ ${A}$ bought INTC shares at ${\text{\textdollar}32.}$ After ${2}$ months, the price is still at ${\text{\textdollar}32.}$ ${A,}$ however, profits, since ${A}$ sold ${B}$ an option at ${\text{\textdollar}1.5.}$ This is a great return. Specifically, a return of ${\text{\textdollar}1.5 / \text{\textdollar}32 = 0.0468 = 4.68\%}$ in ${2}$ months. If we annualize this, we have: ${(12 \, \text{mo} / 2) \times 4.68\% = 28\%}$ annually.
>
> _**Scenario 3: The INTC share price goes up a small amount.**_ ${A}$ bought the INTC shares at ${\text{\textdollar}32.}$ The INTC share price goes up to ${\text{\textdollar}33.}$ Thus, ${A}$ sees a gain of ${\text{\textdollar}33 - \text{\textdollar}32 = \text{\textdollar}1.}$ ${A}$ also sold ${B}$ the call option to buy INTC shares at ${\text{\textdollar}34.}$ ${B,}$ however, doesn't exercise the option since the market has them at ${\text{\textdollar}33.}$ So, ${A}$ sees a ${\text{\textdollar}1}$ gain from each share they bought, and a ${\text{\textdollar}1.5}$ gain from each call option they sold. That's a ${\text{\textdollar}1 + \text{\textdollar}1.5 = \text{\textdollar}2.5}$ gain in ${2}$ months. Which, in turn, is a ${\text{\textdollar}2.5 / \text{\textdollar}32 = 7.8 \%}$ gain in ${2}$ months. Annually, that's a rate of return of ${46.8\%.}$
>
> _**Scenario 4: The INTC share prices goes up a significant amount.**_ ${A}$ bought the INTC shares at ${\text{\textdollar}32.}$ The INTC share price shoots up to ${\text{\textdollar}40.}$ ${B,}$ clearly, will want to exercise their option to buy the INTC shares at ${\text{\textdollar}34}$. But, ${A}$ will still see a again. Since ${A}$ bought shares at ${\text{\textdollar}32}$ and sells them at ${34,}$ ${A}$ sees a gain of ${\text{\textdollar}34 - \text{\textdollar}32 = \text{\textdollar}2}$ per share. On top of that, ${A}$ sees a gain from selling the option at ${\text{\textdollar}1.5.}$ Hence, ${A}$ sees a net gain of ${\text{\textdollar}2 + \text{\textdollar}1.5 = \text{\textdollar}3.5.}$ 

#### Covered Calls Variables
- There are two variables that greatly impact any risk assessment for covered calls: _duration_ and _strike price_.

##### Covered Call Duration
- The more time a call option has, the more time the call option will be. And the more expensive the call option is, the more money you collect as a seller.
- The price of a call option with a duration of ${6}$ months will be higher than the price of a call option with a duration of ${2}$ months.
> __*example*__. A ${6}$-months duration INTC call option for a ${\text{\textdollar}34}$ strike price has an ask price of ${\text{\textdollar}2.6.}$ A ${2}$-months INTC call option for the same strike price (${\text{\textdollar}34}$) has an ask price of ${\text{\textdollar}1.5.}$
> 
> It seems as if the ${\text{\textdollar}1.5}$ ask price option is a better deal. The call option spans ${2}$ months. So, if we bought that call option every ${2}$ months for a total of ${6}$ months, we'd have ${\text{\textdollar}1.5 + \text{\textdollar}1.5 + \text{\textdollar}1.5 = \text{\textdollar}4.5.}$ This is more gain than ${\text{\textdollar}4.5.}$
> 
> Alas: This is true only if the price for the ${2}$-months call option always stays the same. And that almost certainly isn't the case. The price of a call option varies with its associated share price. It could very easily reduce in price by as much as ${\text{\textdollar}0.5,}$ or worse, a whole dollar. 
> 
> The benefit of the ${6}$-months call option: We're guaranteed the ask price of ${\text{\textdollar}2.6}$ for ${6}$ months. 

##### Covered Call Strike Price
- The closer the strike price is to the current price, the more expensive the call option.
- The farther the strike price, the cheaper the call option.

##### Writing Covered Calls
- __First, buy the stock__. Remember, you're dealing with ${100}$ share increments. So, you have to buy ${100}$ shares first.
- __Second, sell the call option.__

## The Federal Reserve
- In the old days, if one bank failed, a domino effect of failing banks occurred—people rushed to their own banks to withdraw funds. This caused widespread panic, sometimes leading to serious economic recessions. 
- In response, Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. This law's objectives:
  1. Ensure banks could acquire emergency cash reserves to meet panic withdrawals. This ensured that the shortage of funds at one bank wouldn't disrupt the entire banking system.
  2. Set the nation's monetary policy.
- The Federal Reserve has three key components:
    1. __The Board of Governors__. Consists of seven members, each appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. The Board—supported by its economists, attorneys, and staff—writes regulations to make commercial banks financially sound.  
    2. __The Reserve Banks__. There are twelve federal reserve banks, each representing a federal reserve district. These banks have three key responsibilities:
        1. Providing financial services.
            - Everyday, banks deposit billions of dollars at their respective reserve bank in cash, checks, wire transfers, or some other form of electronic payment.
        2. Contributing to monetary policy.
        3. Supervising commercial banks.
    3. __The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)__. Eight times a year, the Board's seven governors meet with the presidents of the twelve reserve banks to discuss the current state of the economy and how to (1) promote maximum employment and (2) stabilize prices. The voting members (the seven governors, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four other bank presidents who serve on a rotating basis) then vote on any actions that must be taken to stir the nation towards achieving these two objectives.    

## Value Investing
- __Value investing__ is the practice of purchasing securities or assets for less than they are worth: buying a dollar for 50 cents.

### Market Volatility
- Over the long run, share prices tend to gravitate toward the value of the underlying business.
- Share prices, day-to-day, hold no particular informational value—they are driven by supply and demand and fueled by buyer and seller emotions.
- Volatility highlights an investing hurdle: Despite a spot-on analysis of a company and its value, the stock market can appear to refute it.
- Investors must be resolute in the face of withering criticism from clients and superiors and their own self-doubt during protracted periods of underperformance.
- Value investors should plan to completely exit a security by the time it reaches its full value; owning overvalued securities and hoping they appreciate further is a game for speculators.
- In General: value investors should typically begin selling at a 10% to 20% discount to their assessment of a security’s underlying value.

### Share Mispricing
- Many factors cause share mispricing:
  - __Recent performance.__ A recent, poor earnings reports or credit ratings tend to cause people to start selling. A recent, great earnings reports or credit ratings tend to cause people to start buying.
  - __Herd mentality.__ A person tends to start selling when all their friends start selling; likewise, they tend to start buying when all their friends start buying.
  - __Momentum hypnosis.__ People see an upward trend, and want to "ride the wave," so they buy more and more, even at high prices. Others see a downward trend, so they succumb to fear and start selling, even at much lower prices.
  - __Diamond hands.__ People tend to anchor to the price they paid for an investment and stubbornly hold onto the investment when it runs into trouble, irrationally waiting for it to return to the price they paid for it to get out without a loss.   
  - __Risk trauma.__ After a financial loss, people often beomce more risk-averse, missing out on the next fat pitch. 
  - __Poor estimation.__ People tend to overestimate the future likelihood of events they recently experienced, and underestimate the likelihood of events that haven't lately occurred. 

### Functions of Security Analysis
- There are three functions of security analysis.
  1. __Selective function__ — to determine whether a given issue should be bought, sold, retained, or exchanged for some other. 
  2. __Descriptive function__ —
  3. __Critical function__ —
