## Introduction
- Constitutional law is the body of law governing constitutional issues.
- This outline focuses on federal constitutional law, but occassionally introduces state constitutional issues for compare and contrast.

## Brief History
- At the Pennsylvania State House (later renamed Independence Hall) on July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress passed the Declaration of Independence.
- At Independence Hall, on November 15, 1777, the Second Contintental Congress finalized the Articles of Confederation (the Second Continental Congress was then renamed the Confederation Congress). A few years later, on March 1, 1781, all 13 colonial states ratified the articles. These articles had problems early on:
  1. They treated the states as entirely separate entities.
  2. They allowed each state to veto any changes to the articles, while requiring amendments to be passed by unanimous vote.     
  3. The articles led to a weak central governmentâ€”they did not establish executive or judicial branches.
- Weaknesses within the Articles of Confederation led various legislators to reconsider their viability.
- On February 21, 1787, the Confederation Congress called each state to send delegates to Independence Hall for a convention.
- The convention's intent: Revise the Articles of Confederation. Despite this express intent, the delegates wound up rewriting the Articles completely. 
- Key changes:
   - Only 9 out of 13 states were needed to ratify the finalized document.
   - Additional clauses on the power to tax, regulate interstate commerce, a President with powers, a judiciary with powers, and so on.
- These rewrites led to the modern Constitution.
- On March 4, 1789, at Independence Hall, the Constitutional Convention passed the Constitution.
