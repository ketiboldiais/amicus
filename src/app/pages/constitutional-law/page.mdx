## Introduction
- Constitutional law is the body of law governing constitutional issues.
- This outline focuses on federal constitutional law, but occassionally introduces state constitutional issues for compare and contrast.

## Brief History
- At the Pennsylvania State House (later renamed Independence Hall) on July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress passed the Declaration of Independence.
- At Independence Hall, on November 15, 1777, the Second Contintental Congress finalized the Articles of Confederation (the Second Continental Congress was then renamed the Confederation Congress). A few years later, on March 1, 1781, all 13 colonial states ratified the articles. These articles had problems early on:
  1. They treated the states as entirely separate entities.
  2. They allowed each state to veto any changes to the articles, while requiring amendments to be passed by unanimous vote.     
  3. The articles led to a weak central government—they did not establish executive or judicial branches.
- Weaknesses within the Articles of Confederation led various legislators to reconsider their viability.
- On February 21, 1787, the Confederation Congress called each state to send delegates to Independence Hall for a convention.
- The convention's intent: Revise the Articles of Confederation. Despite this express intent, the delegates wound up rewriting the Articles completely. 
- Key changes:
   - Only 9 out of 13 states were needed to ratify the finalized document.
   - Additional clauses on the power to tax, regulate interstate commerce, a President with powers, a judiciary with powers, and so on.
- These rewrites led to the modern Constitution.
- On March 4, 1789, at Independence Hall, the Constitutional Convention passed the Constitution.

## The Commerce Clause

> The Congress shall have the power ... to regulate Commerce with Foreign Nations and among the several States, and with Indian Tribes. ~U.S. Const.~ art. I, § 8.

- Under the Commerce Clause, Congress is authorized to regulate interstate commerce (commerce among the states, foreign nations, and Indian tribes). _See_ ~U.S. Const.~ art. I, § 8. 
- __What is "commerce?"__
  - Commerce is more than just buying and selling; it also includes commercial activity and all aspects of business. _See_ _Gibbons v. Ogden_, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1 (1824).
- __What is "among the states?"__
  - According to Justice Marshall: "Among" means "intermingled with." _Id_. 
  - If the commerce at issue does not affect other states, then it is not an issue "among the states" and is not subject to federal regulation. _Id_.
  - Inversely, if the commerce at issue does affect other states, then it is an issue "among the states" and is subject to federal regulation. _Id_.  

## Federalism 
> The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. ~U.S. Const.~ amend. X.
- Early on, and continuing to this day, the American public—and by extension, the Judiciary—has had strong and varied opinions on federalism.

| Too much centralized power leads to tyranny. Federalism protects against this by ensuring the states have as much autonomy as possible.             | Large-scale issues (national health care, disaster relief, distribution of wealth, equal protection, etc.) can only be handled by a single, centralized government. |
| Local governments are closer to the people.                                                                                                         | Local governments can rot too (the tyranny of local government can only be stopped by a more powerful, centralized government).                                     |
| Giving more power to local governments leads to a laboratory of ideas and more experiments for trial error—not all good ideas come from Washington. | Blatant problems can take a very long time to fix (e.g., segregation didn't end until 1964 with the passage of the Civil Rights Act).                               |
