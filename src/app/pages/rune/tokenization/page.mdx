## Introduction
Before we begin implementing, we start with some definitions up front. First, the formal definition of a __symbol__: 

> __*definition*__. A _symbol_, or a _token_, is an atomic unit that a machine can read and write.


For example: ${1,}$ ${\pi,}$ ${\Sigma,}$ ${0,}$ ${x,}$ ${y,}$ ${f,}$ are all symbols. If your computer can highlight it with its cursor—that's almost certainly a symbol, or token. If we put these symbols in a box, we call that box an __alphabet__.  

> __*definition*__. An _alphabet_ is a nonempty and finite set of symbols.

A generic alphabet is often denoted with the Greek letter ${\Sigma.}$

Since symbols are discrete things, we can distinguish between them, which allows us to place them in nice, clear sequences. We call such sequences __strings__.

> __*definition*__. A _string_ over an alphabet is a sequence of symbols from that alphabet.

A generic string is often denoted with the Greek letters ${\sigma}$ or ${\tau.}$ We use the Greek letter ${\varepsilon}$ to denote the empty string—a sequence of symbols of zero length.  The set of all strings over an alphabet ${\Sigma}$ is denoted ${\Sigma^{*}.}$

If we take a bunch of strings and put them in a box, we get a __language__.

> __*definition*__. A _language_ ${L}$ over an alphabet ${\Sigma}$ is a set of strings drawn from ${\Sigma.}$ That is, ${L \subseteq \Sigma^{*}.}$

Keep in mind that this is what a language is from a computer science perspective—it's just a set of strings over a specified alphabet.

## Tokens
Now that we know what a token is, let's start by specifying the tokens we want our language, Rune, to recognize.

We make a distinction between _tokens_ and _token types_. The digits ${1,}$ ${2,}$ ${3,}$ and so on, are all _tokens_. We could read each of these tokens one at a time, but it's clear that certain sequences of tokens (_strings_) are always going to be interpreter the same way. For example, the string ${1393}$ is always an _integer_. Likewise, the string `"while"` is always the keyword `"while"`, which we interpret as marking an iteration procedure.  

Below are all the token types Rune recognizes. Within Rune's source code, these are implemented with a TypeScript enum.
