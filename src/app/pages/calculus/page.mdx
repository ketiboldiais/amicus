## Limits
- Informally: Let ${f}$ be a function in ${\reals.}$ Suppose ${f(x)}$ is defined on an open interval about ${c,}$ except possibly at ${c}$ itself. We write
  $$
    \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L
  $$
  if we can make the values of ${f(x)}$ arbitrarily close to ${L}$ by inputting ${x}$ sufficiently close to ${a}$ from either side of ${a}$ but not equal to ${a.}$
- __*example*__. Consider the function ${f(x) = 1/x}$ with domain ${[0, \infty).}$ Examining a table of increasingly large values of ${x}$ alongside its graph:

  | ${x}$      | ${f(x)}$   |
  | ---------- | ---------- |
  | ${1}$      | ${1}$      |
  | ${2}$      | ${0.5}$    |
  | ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$ |
  | ${5}$      | ${0.2}$    |
  | ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$ |
  | ${10}$     | ${0.1}$    |
  | ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$ |
  | ${100}$    | ${0.01}$   |
  | ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$ |
  | ${1000}$   | ${0.001}$  |
  | ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$ |
  | ${10~000}$ | ${0.0001}$ |
  | ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$ |

  We see that ${f(x)}$ grows increasingly small as ${x}$ grows increasingly large (i.e., tending towards positive infinity).
- Limits are a mathematical description of a function's behavior (what its outputs look like) for inputs near, but not equal to, a particular value.

### One-sided Limits
- If we look at the real line, we can approach a particular number on the line from our left (negative infinity) or from our right (positive infinity).
  <REAL_LINE_APPROACHING/>
- Some functions have different limits for a particular value, depending on whether we approach that value from the left or right. One sided limits are what allow us to formally describe these functions' behavior.
- __*definition: lefthand limit*__. We write
  $$
    \lim_{x \to c^-} f(x) = L
  $$ 
  if we can make the values of ${f(x)}$ arbitrarily close to ${L}$ by inputting ${x}$ sufficiently close to, and less than, ${c.}$ If ${L}$ exists, we call ${L}$ the __lefthand limit__ of ${f.}$
- __*definition: righthand limit*__. We write
  $$
    \lim_{x \to c^+} f(x) = L
  $$ 
  if we can make the values of ${f(x)}$ arbitrarily close to ${L}$ by inputting ${x}$ sufficiently close to, and greater than, ${c.}$ If ${L}$ exists, we call ${L}$ the __righthand limit__ of ${f.}$

### Limit Laws
- Where ${c}$ is some real number, the following laws hold.

| Law  | Condition    |
| --- | --- |
| ${\lim\limits_{x \to c} (f(x) + g(x)) = \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x) + \lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)}$ | |
| ${\lim\limits_{x \to c} (f(x) - g(x)) = \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x) - \lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)}$ | |
| ${\lim\limits_{x \to c} (f(x) \cdot g(x)) = \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x) \cdot \lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x)}$ | |
| ${\lim\limits_{x \to c} (k \cdot f(x)) = k \cdot \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)}$ | Where ${k}$ is some real constant. |
| ${\lim\limits_{x \to c} \left(\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right) = \dfrac{ \lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x) }{ \lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x) }}$ | Provided ${\lim\limits_{x \to c} g(x) \neq 0.}$ |
| ${\lim\limits_{x \to c} (f(x))^n = \left(\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)\right)^n}$ | Where ${n}$ is a positive integer. | 
| ${\lim\limits_{x \to c} \sqrt[n]{f(x)} = \sqrt[n]{\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)} = \left(\lim\limits_{x \to c} f(x)\right)^{1/n}}$ | Where ${n}$ is a positive integer. | 

### Limits of Polynomials 
- If ${P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_0,}$ then
  $$
    \lim_{x \to c} P(x) = P(c) = a_n c^n + a_{n-1} c^{n-1} + \ldots a_0.
  $$
- I.e., to evaluate the limit of a polynomial where ${x}$ approaches some real number ${c,}$ simply plug in ${c.}$

### Limits of Rational Functions
- If ${P(x)}$ and ${Q(x)}$ are polynomials and ${Q(c) \neq 0,}$ then
  $$
    \lim_{x \to c} \dfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = \dfrac{P(c)}{Q(c)}.
  $$


## Average Rate of Change
- Let ${f: x \to y}$ be a function ${\reals.}$ The average rate of change of ${y = f(x)}$ with respect to ${x}$ over the interval ${[x_1, x_2]}$ (denoted ${\Delta y / \Delta x}$) is given by the relation:
  $$
    \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} = \dfrac{f(x_1 + h) - f(x_1)}{h}
  $$
  where ${x_2 = x_1 + h.}$
- Geometrically, the rate of change of ${f}$ over the interval ${[x_1, x_2]}$ is the slope of the line through the points ${P(x_1, f(x_1))}$ and ${Q(x_2, f(x_2)).}$

  <AVERAGE_RATE_OF_CHANGE/>

## The Slope-Tangent Relation 
- The tangent line to the curve ${y = f(x)}$ at the point ${P(a, f(a))}$ is the line through ${P}$ with slope
  $$
    m = \lim_{x \to a} \dfrac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}
  $$
  provided this limit exists.
