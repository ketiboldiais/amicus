## Tangent Lines
- Consider the curve ${y = x^2.}$ What is the equation of the line tangent to a point ${P}$ along ${y,}$ namely ${(1,1)?}$

<TANGENT_LINE/>

- We can find the equation of the tangent line by:
  1. Find the slope of the secant line ${PQ:}$
      $$
        m_{PQ} = \dfrac{x^2 - x}{x - 1}.
      $$ 
      E.g., given ${Q(1.5, 2.25):}$
      $$
        m_{PQ} = \dfrac{2.25 - 1}{1.5 - 1} = \dfrac{1.25}{0.5} = 2.5.
      $$
  2. Now consider what happens when we start using values of ${x}$ close to ${1:}$

      | ${x}$      | ${m_{PQ}}$ |
      | ---------- | ---------- |
      | ${2}$      | ${3}$      |
      | ${1.5}$    | ${2.5}$    |
      | ${1.1}$    | ${2.1}$    |
      | ${1.01}$   | ${2.01}$   |
      | ${1.001}$  | ${2.001}$  |
      | ${\vdots}$ | ${\vdots}$ |
      | ${0.999}$  | ${1.999}$  |
      | ${0.99}$   | ${1.99}$   |
      | ${0.9}$    | ${1.9}$    |
      | ${0.5}$    | ${1.5}$    |
      | ${0}$      | ${1}$      |

      It appears that, as the values for ${x}$ get closer to ${1,}$ the slope ${m_{PQ}}$ gets closer to ${2.}$ 
    3. We say that the slope of the tangent line is the limit of the slopes of the secant line, expressed symbolically as: 
        $$
          \lim_{Q \to P} m_{PQ} = m
        $$

        and

        $$
          \lim_{x \to 1} \dfrac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = 2.
        $$


## Limits
- __*definition*__. Let ${f}$ be a function defined on an open interval containing the number ${a,}$ except possibly at ${a}$ itself. Then the limit of ${f}$ as ${x}$ approaches ${a}$ is ${L,}$ and we write: 
  $$
    \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L,
  $$
  if for every ${\varepsilon \gt 0}$ there is a number ${\delta \gt 0}$ such that
  $$
    0 \lt |x - a| \lt \delta \implies | f(x) - L | \lt \varepsilon.
  $$
  - Intuitive breakdown:
    - We have a function ${f.}$
    - Take an open interval in its domain, call it ${[x_0, ..., a, ..., x_1],}$ such that ${f}$ is defined for all the values in the interval, except for possibly input ${a.}$
    - If we can make the outputs of ${f}$ arbitrarily close to some number ${L,}$ by making the inputs ${x}$ as close as we'd like to ${a}$ (but not equal to ${a}$), then we write:  
    $$
      \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L.
    $$
    - Loosely speaking, writing ${\lim_{x \to a} f(x)}$ are a formalization of saying, "The values of ${f(x)}$ approach ${L}$ as ${x}$ approaches ${a.}$" 

### Limit Laws
- Suppose ${c}$ is a constant and the limits ${\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x)}$ and ${\lim\limits_{x \to a} g(x)}$ exist. Then the following laws hold.

#### Limit Sum Law
$$
  \lim_{x \to a} \left(~ f(x) + g(x) ~\right) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) + \lim_{x \to a} g(x).
$$
####  Limit Difference Law  
$$
  \lim_{x \to a} \left(~ f(x) - g(x) ~\right) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) - \lim_{x \to a} g(x).
$$

#### Limit Constant Multiple Law 
$$
  \lim_{x \to a}\left( c f(x) \right) = c \lim_{x \to a} f(x).
$$
    
#### Limit Product Law
$$
  \lim_{x \to a}\left( f(x) \cdot g(x) \right) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \cdot \lim_{x \to a} g(x).
$$

#### Limit Quotient Law
$$
  \lim_{x \to a} \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \dfrac{\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x)}{\lim\limits_{x \to a} g(x)}
$$
provided ${\lim\limits_{x \to a} g(x) \neq 0.}$

#### Limit Power Law
$$
  \lim\limits_{x \to a} \left( f(x) \right)^n = \left( \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \right)^n.
$$

#### Limit Root Law
Where ${n}$ is a positive integer,

$$
  \lim\limits_{x \to a} \sqrt[n]{f(x)} = \sqrt[n]{\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x)}
$$

If ${n}$ is even, we assume that ${\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) \gt 0.}$

#### Limit Constant Law
Where ${c}$ is a constant,
$$
  \lim_{x \to a} c = c.
$$

#### Limit Substitution Law I
Given a variable ${x,}$
$$
  \lim_{x \to a} x = a.
$$

#### Limit Subsitution Law II
Given a variable ${x,}$
$$
  \lim_{x \to a} x^n = a^n.
$$

#### Limit Substitution Law III
Given a variable ${x,}$
$$
  \lim_{x \to a} \sqrt[n]{x} = \sqrt[n]{a},
$$
where ${n}$ is a positive integer. If ${n}$ is even, we assume ${a \gt 0.}$
     
### Properties of Limits
#### Direct Substitution Property
- If ${f}$ is a polynomial or a rational function and ${a}$ is in the domain of ${f,}$ then
  $$
    \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a).
  $$

#### Limit Inequality Theorem
- If ${f(x) \leq g(x)}$ when ${x}$ is near ${a}$ (except possibly at ${a}$) and the limits of ${f}$ and ${g}$ both exist as ${x}$ approaches ${a,}$ then
  $$
    \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \leq \lim_{x \to a} g(x).
  $$

#### The Squeeze Theorem
- If ${f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x)}$ when ${x}$ is near ${a}$ (except possibly at ${a}$) and ${\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = \lim\limits_{x \to a} h(x) = L,}$ then
  $$
    \lim_{x \to a} g(x) = L.
  $$
- __*illustration*__. Below, the curve ${g}$ runs between ${f}$ and ${h.}$
  <SQUEEZE_THEOREM/>
- The Squeeze Theorem is also called the _Sandwich Theorem_ or the _Pinching Theorem_.

## Continuity
- __*definition*__. A function ${f}$ is continous at a number ${a}$ if
  $$
    \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a).
  $$
- From this definition, we have the following checklist for continuity at a point:
  <Checklist> 
    - ${a}$ is in the domain of ${f}$ (i.e, ${f(a)}$ is defined).
    - ${\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x)}$ exists.
    - ${\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a).}$
  </Checklist> 

### Discontinuity
- If ${f}$ is not continous at ${a,}$ we say that ${f}$ is __discontinuous__ at ${a.}$
