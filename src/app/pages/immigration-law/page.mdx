## Ways to Enter the United States
- There are four types of legal authorizations for entering the United States:
  1. Immigrant visa.
  2. Nonimmigrant visa.
  3. Parole.
  4. Asylum.
- The vast majority of those entering the United States do so through a visa (immigrant or nonimmigrant).

<aside>
A visa is an endorsement on a passport showing that the holder is allowed to enter, leave, or stay for a specific period of time. The word traces to the French _visa_, which itself originates in the Latin _charta visa_ (a paper that has been seen).

## Immigrant vs. Nonimmigrant Visas
- There are several distinctions between immigrant and nonimmigrant visas.

## Immigrant Visas
- There is an annual ceiling on the number of immigrant visas issued. 
- There are also per-country limits called __quotas__ (each country is allocated a finite amount of visas).
- There are annual limits per type of immigrant visa issued.
- To obtain a visa, noncitizens file a __petition__ (i.e., "petition for a visa").
- Immigration officials continue processing these petitions, even if the particular country's quota has been met. Instead of denying these petitions, immigration officials place petitioners on a waitlist called the __immigration queue__.
  - The petitioner's place in this queue is a function of three variables:
    1. her country of origin,
    2. the type of visa applied for, and
    3. whether she qualifies for a preference in relation to others in the queue. 

### The 7% Rule 
- Per-country quotas are based on the 7% rule. 
- With limited exceptions, the total number of family-based and employment-based immigrants admitted from any one country in a fiscal year can't exceed 7% of the total number of all visas from the visa-preference categories. 
- __*example*__. Suppose the total number of all visas from the visa-preference categories is ${1~000~000.}$ Then the total number of family- and employment-based immigrants admitted from, say, India, must be less than or equal to ${70~000}$ in any given fiscal year.
- In general, there are ${675~000}$ total immigrant visas per year. In practice, this number varies because of the myriad of exceptions in immigration law. Keeping this caveat in mind:
  - ${\approx 480~000}$ visas are allocated for family-sponsored immigrants.
  - ${\approx 140~000}$ visas are allocated for employment-based immigrants.
  - ${\approx 55~000}$ visas are allocated for diversity immigrants.
