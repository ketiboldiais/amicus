## Introduction
Civil procedure is the body of law governing procedures for civil cases. This outline focuses on the federal rules of civil procedure. Occassionally, state rules of civil procedure are discussed for compare and contrast.

When confronting a civil case, the attorney should ask the following questions before even considering the case's substantive issues:

1. Who are the parties?
2. Which court is this case being brought to?
    - I.e., which court will hear this case?   
    - All cases must have proper [venue](#venue).  
3. Does that court have jurisdiction?
    - A court must have jurisdiction to hear the case in the first place.
4. What will discovery look like?
    - Discovery is the process of obtaining evidence in preparation for trial.   
    - Having some idea of what this process will look like can help the attorney plan, set realistic expectations for the client, and determine the costs of proceeding to trial. 
5. Are there multiple parties?
    - For cases involving multiple parties, the attorney must determine whether a particular type of joinder is permitted and practical.   

## Jurisdiction
- For a federal court to hear a case, it must have (1) [personal jurisdiction](#personal-jurisdiction) and (2) [subject matter jurisdiction](#subject-matter-jurisdiction).


<details>
<summary> __*exercise*__. Why are American courts so careful with jurisdiction?</summary>

There are a few reasons: 

1. __We highly value state sovereignty, while recognizing the need for central government.__ Limiting federal jurisdiction ensures state courts continue handling local disputes and the majority of cases (the federal courts simply do not have the resources to handle every case in the country). At the same time, we reserve certain issues specifically for the federal courts as a matter of pragmatism, efficiency, or adherence to the Constitution.   
2. __We want litigation to be convenient for the parties involved.__ If an accident occurs in New Jersey, and the parties are all from New Jersey, it only makes sense to have litigation in New Jersey, rather than, say, New York.   
3. __Citizens or residents of a state expect the state's protection when conducting business within that state, and in our view, if one receives such protections, they—in return—owe an obligation to appear in that state's courts.__ This is self-explanatory—if you expect the Cook County sheriff to protect and enforce your rights against others, then, at the very least, you should also expect to appear in an Illinois court.

## Personal Jurisdiction
- Personal jurisdiction is a court's authority to enforce a judgment against a particular defendant or item of property.
- A court can obtain personal jurisdiction in three ways: (a) [in personam jurisdiction](#in-personam-jurisdiction), (b) [in rem jurisdiction](#in-rem-jurisdiction), or (c) [quasi in rem jurisdiction.](#quasi-in-rem-jurisdiction) 

### In Personam Jurisdiction
- There are three ways for a court to obtain _in personam jurisdiction_: (1) [traditional personal jurisdiction](#traditional-personal-jurisdiction), (2) [specific jurisdiction](#specific-jurisdiction), or (3) [general jurisdiction](#general-jurisdiction).

#### Traditional Personal Jurisdiction
<details>
<summary>__*case brief*__: _Pennoyer v. Neff_, 95 U.S. 714 (1877).</summary>

- __*facts*__
  - Plaintiff Neff hired Mitchell for legal services.
  - Neff failed to pay Mitchell, so Mitchell sued in Oregon state court. 
  - Neff, however, was not a resident of Oregon. 
  - Instead of personally serving Neff notice, Mitchell published a notice of the summons in a local newspaper. 
  - After Neff failed to appear, the Oregon state court entered a default judgment against Neff.
  - Shortly after, Neff obtained title to a tract of land in Oregon.
  - Learning this, Mitchell had the sheriff seize the land for sale, so as to satisfy the judgment.
  - Mitchell bought the land at the sale and assigned it to Pennoyer.
  - Filing in federal court (the United States Circuit Court for the District of Oregon), Neff sued Pennoyer to recover the property.
  - The federal court found the Oregon state court's judgment invalid because of ineffective service.  
- __*issue*__
  - If a party has no connection with a state other than ownership of property within that state, can the party still be subject to that state's jurisdiction? 
- __*analysis*__
  - No.

</details>

- Under traditional personal jurisdiction, a court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant if at least one of the following conditions holds:
  1. the defendant is [physically present](#jurisdiction-by-physical-presence) within the forum state at the time of service[^tag_jdx]; 
  2. the defendant explicitly consents to personal jurisdiction through express agreement;
  3. the defendant [implicitly consents](#jurisdiction-by-implicit-consent) to personal jurisdiction by their actions;
  4. the defendant is domiciled within the forum state; OR
  5. for corporate defendants, the defendant is incorporated, and has their principal place of business, within the forum state.  

[^tag_jdx]: This is sometimes called _tag jurisdiction_. 

##### Jurisdiction by Physical Presence
- If a defendant is within the territorial limits of a state and is properly served, then the defendant may be subject to that state's jurisdiction.[^grace_v_macarthur] 

[^grace_v_macarthur]: _Grace v. Macarthur_, 170 F. Supp. 442 (E.D. Ark. 1959).

##### Jurisdiction by Implicit Consent
- A non-resident may implicitly consent to state court jurisdiction and substituted service of process for claims arising from the nonresident's use of the state's highways.[^pawloski]

[^pawloski]: _Hess v. Pawloski_, 274 U.S. 352 (1927).

#### Specific Jurisdiction 
- A court has __specific jurisdiction__ if (1) the defendant has "minimum contacts" with the forum state, and (2) an exercise of personal jurisdiction is consistent with "fair play and substantial justice."[^international_shoe]  
[^international_shoe]: _International Shoe Co. v. Washington_, 326 U.S. 310 (1945).

##### Minimum Contacts

##### Fair Play and Substantial Justice

#### General Jurisdiction
- A court has __general jurisdiction__, or __general personal jurisdiction__, if the defendant is "at home" in the forum state. _See_ _Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown_, 564 U.S. 915 (2011).

##### The "At Home" Requirement
- If the defendant is a corporation, then the defendant is "at home" in the forum state if the corporation is (1) incorporated in the forum state and (2) the forum state is its "principal place of business."[^daimler-at-home]   

[^daimler-at-home]: _See_ _Daimler A.G. v. Bauman_, 571 U.S. 117 (2014).

### In Rem Jurisdiction
- A court has __in rem jurisdiction__ if (1) the issue concerns disposition of property, (2) the property is located within the forum state, and (3) the property was not brought to the forum state by fraud or trick.[^in_rem1]

[^in_rem1]: _See_ _Alpern v. Coe_, 352 Pa. 208 (1945) (holding that the real estate's location in Pennsylvania gives the court in rem jurisdiction). _See generally_, Beale, "The Exercise of Jurisdiction in Rem to Compel Payment of a Debt," 27 ~Harv. L. Rev.~ 107 (1913).

### Quasi In Rem Jurisdiction

### Personal Jurisdiction Abroad
- The United States may exercise personal jurisdiction over its nationals and citizens abroad, and may impose penalties for disobeying U.S. laws, provided due process is provided.[^blackmer]

[^blackmer]: _Blackmer v. United States_, 284 U.S. 421 (1932).

### Limits on Personal Jurisdiction
- A court has personal jurisdiction only if (1) a statute provides the court personal jurisdiction, and (2) assuming the court has personal jurisdiction, exercising personal jurisdiction would not violate the Constitution. 

## Subject Matter Jurisdiction
- Subject matter jurisdiction is a court's authority to deal with a specific subject or issue.
  - E.g., the United States Tax Court only deals with federal tax cases, the United States Bankruptcy Courts can only handle bankruptcy cases, etc.  
- A court can have subject matter jurisdiction in four ways: (1) _diversity jurisdiction_, (2) _federal question jurisdiction_, (3) _removal jurisdiction_, (4) _supplemental jurisdiction_.

#### Diversity Jurisdiction 
#### Federal Question Jurisdiction 
#### Removal Jurisdiction
#### Supplemental Jurisdiction
