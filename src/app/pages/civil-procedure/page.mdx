# Civil Procedure

## Jurisdiction
- Jurisdiction is a court's authority to adjudicate a case and order, direct, or punish the parties of that case.
- Absent jurisdiction, the court has no such authority.
- Civil cases in federal courts are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) and provisions of Title 28 of the United States Code.
- To hear a civil case, a federal court must have:
  1. subject-matter jurisdction,
  2. personal jurisdiction, and
  3. proper venue.  

### Subject-matter Jurisdiction
- Subject-matter jurisdiction is a court's power to hear and determine cases of a particular type.[^21_cjs]
[^21_cjs]: _See_ 21 C.J.S. Courts § 11 (2006).
- Subject-matter jurisdiction is non-waivable—any party may challenge subject-matter jurisdiction at any time, even for the first time on appeal.[^mottley]
[^mottley]: _See_ _Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Mottley_, 211 U.S. 149 (1908).

### Federal-question Jurisdiction
- A federal court has _federal-question jurisdiction_ if and only if the plaintiff's allegations raise a claim under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.[^art3_s2]
[^art3_s2]: U.S. ~Const.~ art. III, § 2.
  - Federal-question jurisdiction first appeared at the Constitutional Convention as part of the Virginia Plan. The ninth of the fifteen resolutions in the Virginia Plan authorized federal courts to hear "questions which may involve the national peace and harmony.[^farrand] 
  [^farrand]: 1 ~The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787~, at 22 (Max Farrand ed., rev. ed. 1966).
  - Edmund Randolph presented the plan at the Convention, observing the difficulties of establishing the powers of the judiciary, but emphasizing that one purpose was "to preserve the harmony of states and that of the citizens thereof."[^randolph]
  [^randolph]: 1 ~The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787~, at 238 (Max Farrand ed., rev. ed. 1966).

### Diversity Jurisdiction
- Federal courts have diversity jurisdiction over civil actions if and only if: (1) there is complete diversity of citizenship and (2) the claim satisfies the statutory amount-in-controversy requirement.[^diversity]

[^diversity]: U.S. ~Const.~ art. III, § 2 ("The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, ... between citizens of different states..."). 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1) ("The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and is between— (1) citizens of different States...").

#### Complete Diversity of Citizenship
- A federal court may not exercise diversity jurisdiction if any one of the plaintiffs is a citizen of the same state as any one of the defendants.[^28_usc_1332]
[^28_usc_1332]: 28 U.S.C. § 1332.
- An individual's citizenship is determined by the individual's domicile, not residency.[^diversity_domicile]
  - Pleading Example: "John Smith, an individual, is domiciled in the state of ___ and is a citizen of that state for diversity purposes."
[^diversity_domicile]: _Mas v. Perry_, 489 F.2d 1396, 1399 (5th Cir. 1974).
- The citizenship of a corporation is determined by place of incorporation _and_ principal place of business—both must be affirmatively alleged.[^corporation_citizenship]
  - Pleading Example: “ABC, Inc. is a corporation incorporated in the state of __, with its principal place of business in the state of __."
[^corporation_citizenship]: See _Getty Oil, Div. of Texaco v. Ins. Co. of North America_, 841 F.2d 1254, 1259 (5th Cir. 1988)
