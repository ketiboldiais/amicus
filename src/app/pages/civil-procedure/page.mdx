## Introduction
- Civil procedure is the body of law governing procedures for civil cases.
- This outline focuses on the federal rules of civil procedure. Occassionally, state rules of civil procedure are discussed for compare and contrast.
- When confronting a civil case, the attorney should ask the following questions before even considering the case's substantive issues:
  1. Who are the parties?
  2. Which court is this case being brought to?
     - I.e., which court will hear this case?   
     - All cases must have proper _venue_.  
  3. Does that court have jurisdiction?
     - A court must have jurisdiction to hear the case in the first place.
  4. What will discovery look like?
     - Discovery is the process of obtaining evidence in preparation for trial.   
     - Having some idea of what this process will look like can help the attorney plan, set realistic expectations for the client, and determine the costs of proceeding to trial. 
  5. Are there multiple parties?
     - For cases involving multiple parties, the attorney must determine whether a particular type of joinder is permitted and practical.   

## Jurisdiction
- For a federal court to hear a case, it must have (1) _personal jurisdiction_ and (2) _subject matter jurisdiction_.

## Personal Jurisdiction
- Personal jurisdiction is a court's authority to enforce a judgment against a particular defendant or item of property.
- A court can obtain personal jurisdiction in three ways: (a) _in personam_, (b) _in rem_, or (c) _quasi in rem_. 

### Limits on Personal Jurisdiction
- A court has personal jurisdiction only if (1) a statute provides the court personal jurisdiction, and (2) assuming the court has personal jurisdiction, exercising personal jurisdiction would not violate the Constitution. 

## Subject Matter Jurisdiction
- Subject matter jurisdiction is a court's authority to deal with a specific subject or issue.
  - E.g., the United States Tax Court only deals with federal tax cases, the United States Bankruptcy Courts can only handle bankruptcy cases, etc.  
- A court can have subject matter jurisdiction in four ways: (1) _diversity jurisdiction_, (2) _federal question jurisdiction_, (3) _removal jurisdiction_, (4) _supplemental jurisdiction_.
