## Introduction
Civil procedure is the body of law governing procedures for civil cases. This outline focuses on the federal rules of civil procedure. Occassionally, state rules of civil procedure are discussed for compare and contrast.

When confronting a civil case, the attorney should ask the following questions before even considering the case's substantive issues:

1. Who are the parties?
2. Which court is this case being brought to?
    - I.e., which court will hear this case?   
    - All cases must have proper [venue](#venue).  
3. Does that court have jurisdiction?
    - A court must have jurisdiction to hear the case in the first place.
4. What will discovery look like?
    - Discovery is the process of obtaining evidence in preparation for trial.   
    - Having some idea of what this process will look like can help the attorney plan, set realistic expectations for the client, and determine the costs of proceeding to trial. 
5. Are there multiple parties?
    - For cases involving multiple parties, the attorney must determine whether a particular type of joinder is permitted and practical.   

## Jurisdiction
- For a federal court to hear a case, it must have (1) [personal jurisdiction](#personal-jurisdiction) and (2) [subject matter jurisdiction](#subject-matter-jurisdiction).

## Personal Jurisdiction
- Personal jurisdiction is a court's authority to enforce a judgment against a particular defendant or item of property.
- A court can obtain personal jurisdiction in three ways: (a) [in personam jurisdiction](#in-personam-jurisdiction), (b) [in rem jurisdiction](#in-rem-jurisdiction), or (c) [quasi in rem jurisdiction](#quasi-in-rem-jurisdiction). 

### In Personam Jurisdiction
- There are three ways for a court to obtain _in personam jurisdiction_: (1) [traditional personal jurisdiction](#traditional-personal-jurisdiction), (2) [specific jurisdiction](#specific-jurisdiction), or (3) [general jurisdiction](#general-jurisdiction).

#### Traditional Personal Jurisdiction
- Under traditional personal jurisdiction, a court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant if at least one of the following conditions holds:
  1. the defendant is physically peresent within the forum state at the time of service[^tag_jdx]; 
  2. the defendant consents to personal jurisdiction through express agreement;
  3. the defendant consents to personal jurisdiction implicitly by their actions;
  4. the defendant is domiciled within the forum state; OR
  5. for corporate defendants, the defendant is incorporated, and has their principal place of business, within the forum state.  

[^tag_jdx]: This is sometimes called _tag jurisdiction_. 

#### Specific Jurisdiction 
- A court has __specific jurisdiction__, or __specific personal jurisdiction__, if the cause of action (a) arises out of the defendant's activities within the forum state or (b) the defendant has sufficient connections with the forum state.  

#### General Jurisdiction
- A court has __general jurisdiction__, or __general personal jurisdiction__, if the defendant is "at home" in the forum state. _See_ _Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown_, 564 U.S. 915 (2011).

##### The "At Home" Requirement
- If the defendant is a corporation, then the defendant is "at home" in the forum state if the corporation is (1) incorporated in the forum state and (2) the forum state is its "principal place of business." _See_ _Daimler A.G. v. Bauman_, 571 U.S. 117 (2014).  

### In Rem Jurisdiction

### Quasi In Rem Jurisdiction

### Limits on Personal Jurisdiction
- A court has personal jurisdiction only if (1) a statute provides the court personal jurisdiction, and (2) assuming the court has personal jurisdiction, exercising personal jurisdiction would not violate the Constitution. 

## Subject Matter Jurisdiction
- Subject matter jurisdiction is a court's authority to deal with a specific subject or issue.
  - E.g., the United States Tax Court only deals with federal tax cases, the United States Bankruptcy Courts can only handle bankruptcy cases, etc.  
- A court can have subject matter jurisdiction in four ways: (1) _diversity jurisdiction_, (2) _federal question jurisdiction_, (3) _removal jurisdiction_, (4) _supplemental jurisdiction_.

#### Diversity Jurisdiction 
#### Federal Question Jurisdiction 
#### Removal Jurisdiction
#### Supplemental Jurisdiction
