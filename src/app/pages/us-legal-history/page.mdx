## English Religious Conflict
- In 1603, Queen Elizabeth I died without an heir.
- Her cousin, James VI of Scotland, assumed the English throne as King James I, and called his joint kingdom Great Britain. 
- During James I's rule, the Church of England split: Puritans on one side and Anglicans the other. 
	- The Anglicans wanted to keep their traditions and the status quo.
	- The Puritans wanted reform: no lavish cathedrals, no statues of Jesus, no bishops or archbishops—nothing resembling Catholic rituals.
		- Some Puritans believed the Church of England was so corrupt it was beyond reform. These Puritans called their own congregations separate from the Church (an illicit act, given that English law required all persons to attend Anglican church services). These Puritans were called __separatists__ or __nonconformists__.
		- James I threatened the separatists: Conform or be exhiled. A group of these separatists left for America in response; this group would later be known as the __Pilgrims__.  

## The English Civil War
- In 1625, Charles I succeeded James I.
- Charles I firmly believed he ruled by divine right and exercised that right freely—he raised taxes without consulting Parliament, harassed the Puritans, and disbanded Parliament from 1629 to 1640. 
  - The final straw: Forcing Anglican forms of worship on Presbyterian Scots. 
	- In 1638 Scotland rose in revolt; desperate to save his skin, Charles revived Parliament in 1640, ordering its members to raises taxes. 
	- Parliament, however, refused.
	- In 1642, Charles I tried to arrest five members of Parliament. 
	- This led to the English Civil War—a war between Royalists (those who supported Charles I) and Parliamentarians (those who supported Parliament).
	- In 1646, Oliver Cromwell led parliamentary forces in capturing Charles I. After a public trial, Charles I was beheaded for high treason. 
	- Cromwell ruled Britain under a Puritan military dictatorship, outlawing Roman Catholics and Anglicans.
    	- Many Anglican royalists, called the _Cavaliers_, escaped by sailing to Virginia.

## The Glorious Revolution
- After Cromwell died of natural causes in 1658, the army allowed new elections for Parliament, and in 1660, supported the Restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, the eldest son of Charles I. 
- Charles II ruled jointly with Parliament and for a period, Britain was at peace.
- Charles II died of an apoplectic fit (sudden rupture of internal organs), and his younger, James II, succeeded him as King. 
- James II openly defied Parliament and murdered or imprisoned his political opponents.
- The English, however, tolerated James II's rule as long as one of his protestant daughters, Mary or Anne, succeeded him.
- James II, however, suddenly had a son, who he intended to raise Roman Catholic. 
- This prompted political, religious, and military leaders to urge Mary and her Dutch Protestant husband, Prince William III of Orange, to invade England and oust James II. 
- The huge Dutch army landed in England, and James II fled to France. 

## The American Colonies
- Spanish colonization was directly funded by the monarchy, and the wealth obtained became property of the monarchs. 
- English colonization, however, was different—it was largely a private venture, led by churches (those seeking religious freedom) and companies (those seeking wealth).
- Without support from a central government, investors banded together to buy shares in __joint-stock companies__.
  - This allowed raising the large amounts of money needed to establish settlements in the Americas.
  - If the settlement failed, no single investor would suffer a loss; if the settlement succeeded, then profits would be distributed among investors based on the amount of shares they owned. 
- The Spanish, French, and Dutch often lived among the Native Americans and intermarried. The English, however, viewed them as threats to be removed.

### Finding Settlers
- To encourage settlement, English investors encouraged social rebels, religious dissenters, vigrants, the landless, and the homeless to migrate.
  - Vigrants, the landless, and the homeless were easy to find, given a large population explosion in the late 16th century.   
  - The number of landless also increased from changes in the English economy—because of an increased demand for wool products, English landlords evicted farmers to free up land for grazing sheep.
- The English government also helped: Some ${50~000}$ British convicts were shipped to America as servants for hire along with several thousand political prisoners, mostly Scots.

### Virginia 
- April 1606: King James I charters a joint-stock enterprise named the _Virginia Company_.
- December 1606: The Virginia Company sent three ships carrying ${104}$ colonists, all men and boys. 
- May 1607: The ships arrived at Chesapeake Bay (a bay extending about ${200}$ miles along the coasts of Virgnia and Maryland).
  - The colonists established a settlement they called __Jamestown__, in honor of King James I.
  - By the end of the year, almost all the colonists died of either disease, prolonged drought, starvation, or violence.
