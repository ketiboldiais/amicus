## English Religious Conflict
- In 1603, Queen Elizabeth I died without an heir.
- Her cousin, James VI of Scotland, assumed the English throne as King James I, and called his joint kingdom Great Britain. 
- During James I's rule, the Church of England split: Puritans on one side and Anglicans the other. 
	- The Anglicans wanted to keep their traditions and the status quo.
	- The Puritans wanted reform: no lavish cathedrals, no statues of Jesus, no bishops or archbishops—nothing resembling Catholic rituals.
		- Some Puritans believed the Church of England was so corrupt it was beyond reform. These Puritans called their own congregations separate from the Church (an illicit act, given that English law required all persons to attend Anglican church services). These Puritans were called __separatists__ or __nonconformists__.
		- James I threatened the separatists: Conform or be exhiled. A group of these separatists left for America in response; this group would later be known as the __Pilgrims__.  

## The English Civil War
- In 1625, Charles I succeeded James I.
- Charles I firmly believed he ruled by divine right and exercised that right freely—he raised taxes without consulting Parliament, harassed the Puritans, and disbanded Parliament from 1629 to 1640. 
  - The final straw: Forcing Anglican forms of worship on Presbyterian Scots. 
	- In 1638 Scotland rose in revolt; desperate to save his skin, Charles revived Parliament in 1640, ordering its members to raises taxes. 
	- Parliament, however, refused.
	- In 1642, Charles I tried to arrest five members of Parliament. 
	- This led to the English Civil War—a war between Royalists (those who supported Charles I) and Parliamentarians (those who supported Parliament).
	- In 1646, Oliver Cromwell led parliamentary forces in capturing Charles I. After a public trial, Charles I was beheaded for high treason. 
	- Cromwell ruled Britain under a Puritan military dictatorship, outlawing Roman Catholics and Anglicans.
    	- Many Anglican royalists, called the _Cavaliers_, escaped by sailing to Virginia.

## The Glorious Revolution
- After Cromwell died of natural causes in 1658, the army allowed new elections for Parliament, and in 1660, supported the Restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, the eldest son of Charles I. 
- Charles II ruled jointly with Parliament and for a period, Britain was at peace.
- Charles II died of an apoplectic fit (sudden rupture of internal organs), and his younger, James II, succeeded him as King. 
- James II openly defied Parliament and murdered or imprisoned his political opponents.
- The English, however, tolerated James II's rule as long as one of his protestant daughters, Mary or Anne, succeeded him.
- James II, however, suddenly had a son, who he intended to raise Roman Catholic. 
- This prompted political, religious, and military leaders to urge Mary and her Dutch Protestant husband, Prince William III of Orange, to invade England and oust James II. 
- The huge Dutch army landed in England, and James II fled to France.
